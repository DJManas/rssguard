Downloads
=========

Official place to download RSS Guard is at `Github Releases page <https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/releases>`_. You can also download the `development (beta) build <https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/releases/tag/devbuild>`_, which is updated automatically every time the source code is updated.

RSS Guard is also available in `repositories of many Linux distributions <https://repology.org/project/rssguard/versions>`_, and via `Flathub <https://flathub.org/about>`_.

The are two different flavors:
 * `Regular <https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.martinrotter.rssguard>`_: Includes an (almost) full-blown integrated web browser (built with ``-DUSE_WEBENGINE=ON``).
 * `Lite <https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.martinrotter.rssguardlite>`_: Includes simpler, safer (and less memory hungry integrated web browser (built with ``-DUSE_WEBENGINE=OFF``).

I highly recommend to download RSS Guard only from trusted sources.
